#### Lexer
- The First thing needed is the ability to process a text file and recognize what it days.
- A way to do this is to use a *"lexer"* (aka 'Scanner') to break the input up into "tokens".
- Each token returned by the lexer includes a token code and potentially some metadata (e.g. the numeric value of a number).
